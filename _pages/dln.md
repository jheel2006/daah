### Digital Literacy and the Evolving Role of Technology in Knowledge Creation

As a **Computer Science and Interactive Media** major, *digital literacy* is central to how I work, learn, and create. Initially, I saw digital literacy as merely the ability to navigate online spaces effectively—understanding how to search for information, evaluate sources, and use digital tools productively. However, through our discussions and readings, I now see digital literacy as something far more complex: it is about **critically engaging with digital systems, understanding the biases embedded within them, and recognizing the broader implications of digital technologies on knowledge production**.

One of the key insights I have gained is the importance of **questioning** the ways digital tools shape our understanding of the world. Johanna Drucker, in *Digital Humanities: An Overview*, emphasizes that **digital knowledge production is not neutral**; it is shaped by the structures and assumptions embedded in the tools we use (Drucker, ch. 1). This realization has made me more aware of how platforms like **search engines, large language models, and digital archives** are not just repositories of knowledge but **active participants** in framing what counts as knowledge in the first place.

For example, when working with AI-driven platforms like ChatGPT, it’s easy to assume that the responses generated are **purely factual or objective**. However, as we discussed in class, these models are built on massive datasets that contain **biases, omissions, and limitations**. Drucker’s analysis of the digital humanities reminds us that **every digital tool is built on human decisions**—decisions about what to include, how to categorize information, and what kinds of interactions the system should allow. This perspective has reshaped how I approach AI-generated content: instead of taking it at face value, I now **question the assumptions behind it** and consider **what voices or perspectives might be missing**.

Another major shift in my thinking has been recognizing the divide between **making and analyzing** in digital spaces. In her article *Why I Am Not a Maker*, **Debbie Chachra** critiques the cultural tendency to **value creation**—coding, designing, building—over work that involves **care, maintenance, and analysis** (Chachra, 2015). She argues that this bias **undervalues the labor of educators, researchers, and others** who contribute to knowledge in non-material ways. This perspective resonated deeply with me, especially in the context of digital literacy. While I spend much of my time working with **programming, UI/UX design, and digital research**, Chachra’s argument helped me recognize that **engaging critically with technology**—asking the right questions, evaluating the ethical implications, and understanding systemic biases—is just as crucial as the act of creating itself.

This perspective has also changed how I view my own engagement with digital tools. I used to feel that to be truly digitally literate, I needed to **master programming or data analysis**. While these skills are undoubtedly valuable, I now recognize that **understanding the structures that shape digital interactions** is just as important. Whether I am **building an interactive web application with React.js, experimenting with generative art in p5.js, or structuring data in Firebase**, I strive to remain **critically aware** of how these tools frame digital experiences and knowledge production.

In practical terms, this means I now approach digital tools with a more **questioning mindset**. For instance, when using **AI-generated summaries or search algorithms**, I try to think about **what decisions went into the system’s design**. **Who decided what information to prioritize? What perspectives are missing?** This level of awareness has also changed how I interact with **digital archives and research tools**, as I now look more closely at their **underlying structures and metadata** rather than just focusing on the content they provide.

Another crucial aspect of digital literacy that I have come to appreciate is the **role of collaboration and shared knowledge production**. Digital platforms, from **GitHub to OpenStreetMap**, rely on **collective contributions and negotiated standards of accuracy and reliability**. The **Making and Knowing Project**, for example, is a fascinating case study in how digital tools can be used to **reconstruct historical knowledge** through **collaborative annotation and interpretation**. This project underscores the fact that **digital literacy is not just about individual competency but also about navigating and contributing to larger knowledge communities**.

Beyond structured research and formal projects, I also see digital literacy shaping my **everyday interactions and creative processes**. Whether **designing interactive art in Processing** or **collaborating on an open-source project**, I realize that the way I interact with digital spaces extends beyond technical skills. It involves an **ethical dimension**—considering **who has access to digital tools, whose voices are amplified, and how technology is used to shape narratives**. These are questions I increasingly ask myself as I work on projects that combine **art, computation, and interactivity**.

This understanding also influences the way I **design digital experiences**. As an **interactive media student**, I aim to create projects that not only **engage users** but also **prompt critical reflection on the role of technology**. For example, in a recent **generative art project**, I experimented with how **randomness and algorithmic biases influence visual composition**. The process made me more aware of how even **creative coding is shaped by underlying computational structures and limitations**. These insights push me to think more critically about the **ethical considerations of interactive media**, especially in areas like **accessibility, inclusivity, and data privacy**.

Looking ahead, I want to continue expanding my digital literacy by exploring more **hands-on engagement with digital humanities tools** while further refining my ability to **design and build interactive experiences**. I am particularly interested in how **AI, real-time graphics, and data visualization** can be integrated into **creative and educational platforms**. At the same time, I want to **maintain a critical stance toward the technologies I use**, recognizing their limitations and the ways they can shape knowledge in sometimes problematic ways. By integrating both the **technical and analytical** sides of digital literacy, I hope to become **not just a proficient user of digital tools but a more thoughtful and responsible participant in the digital world**.

In sum, my understanding of digital literacy has evolved from a **functional perspective**—where it was mostly about **knowing how to use digital tools**—toward a more **critical and engaged perspective**. Digital literacy is about **questioning, analyzing, and recognizing the social and political dimensions of digital technologies**. It involves both **technical skills and critical thinking**, and it requires an awareness of how **digital systems are designed and who they serve**. Readings like Drucker’s *Digital Humanities* and Chachra’s *Why I Am Not a Maker* have been **instrumental in shaping this understanding**, and I look forward to continuing this exploration throughout the course.
