title: "Digital Literacy Narrative"
---

As a **Computer Science and Interactive Media** major, digital literacy is central to how I work, learn, and create. For me, itâ€™s more than just understanding technologyâ€”itâ€™s about **building, analyzing, and designing interactive experiences** that blend technical depth with creativity. Every day, I engage with **programming, UI/UX design, and digital research**, constantly refining my ability to navigate and shape digital environments.  

This semester, I want to push my **computational thinking** furtherâ€”exploring **AI, real-time graphics, data visualization, and ethical AI**. I also aim to sharpen my ability to manage and communicate information effectively, whether through **web development, interactive media, or creative coding**.  

## **Digital Literacy in Content Creation and Social Interaction**  

Most of my digital content isnâ€™t traditional writing or bloggingâ€”itâ€™s **interactive experiences, UI/UX prototypes, and web-based applications**. Instead of Medium or Substack, my workflow involves:  

- **React.js & GitHub Pages** â€“ For building and deploying interactive web projects.  
- **p5.js & Processing** â€“ For creative coding and generative art.  
- **Arduino** â€“ For connecting hardware with interactive systems.  
- **Figma & Procreate** â€“ For UI/UX design and digital illustration.  

Collaboration is just as essential as creation. While some students rely on Slack and Trello, I mostly use:  

- **GitHub Projects** â€“ For version control, tracking issues, and collaborating on codebases.  
- **Discord** â€“ For engaging with developer and design communities.  
- **Notion** â€“ For structuring project ideas, documentation, and brainstorming.  

A big part of my learning has been understanding **how design and accessibility shape user interaction**. Whether itâ€™s improving UI/UX in a web app or optimizing an interactive project, Iâ€™m always thinking about **how people experience digital spaces**.  

## **Digital Research and Data Management**  

Digital literacy isnâ€™t just about using toolsâ€”itâ€™s about organizing and making sense of information efficiently. Instead of traditional research managers like Zotero, I work with:  

- **MySQL & Firebase** â€“ For managing structured and real-time databases.  
- **Jupyter Notebooks & Colab** â€“ For prototyping AI models and data analysis.  
- **APIs & Web Scraping** â€“ For gathering and processing data dynamically.  

For data visualization and analysis, I rely on:  

- **Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)** â€“ To generate insights from datasets.  
- **TensorFlow & OpenCV** â€“ To explore AI-driven image recognition and machine learning.  
- **D3.js** â€“ To create interactive, web-based visualizations.  

These tools help me explore the **intersection of computation, design, and interactivity**, whether in an **AI project, interactive website, or digital art experiment**.  

## **Digital Humanities & Computational Thinking**  

One of the most exciting aspects of digital literacy is how it connects **technology, design, and human expression**. Digital humanities is a space where **coding meets creativity**, whether through **AI-generated art, interactive storytelling, or immersive media**.  

For example:  
- **Runway ML & Stable Diffusion** â€“ Are transforming how we generate digital art.  
- **Generative algorithms** in p5.js and Processing â€“ Enable **new forms of creative expression**.  
- **Narrative AI systems** â€“ Are pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling and game development.  

This semester, I want to dive deeper into **computational thinking**, as described by Berry and Fagerjordâ€”not just as a technical skill but as a **way of problem-solving across disciplines**. Some of my key focus areas include:  

- How **machine learning** can inform creative workflows.  
- How **algorithmic approaches** can enhance generative design and storytelling.  
- How **data and AI** shape digital culture ([AI in Museums](https://www.transcript-publishing.com/978-3-8376-6710-3/ai-in-museums/?number=978-3-8394-6710-7)).  

## **Critical Reflections and Future Growth**  

I feel confident in my ability to **code, design, and analyze data**, but I know there are areas where I can grow. Some questions Iâ€™m exploring:  

- **Ethical AI & Bias** â€“ How do we make AI systems **fair, transparent, and responsible**?  
- **Real-time Graphics & XR** â€“ How can I push interactive media through **AR/VR and real-time rendering**?  
- **Generative AI & Creativity** â€“ How do we balance **AI-assisted creativity with human expression**?  

## **Conclusion**  

Digital literacy isnâ€™t a static skillâ€”itâ€™s an evolving practice of **learning, experimenting, and reflecting**. As I continue my studies, I want to deepen my understanding of **AI, computational media, and UI/UX design**, while developing a **critical perspective on technology**. The **interdisciplinary nature** of my work in **Computer Science and Interactive Media** provides a space to explore how **technology, creativity, and ethics intersect**â€”something I hope to refine further this semester.

## **Next Steps: Documenting My Changes in GitHub**  

> _I documented my work by committing these changes on GitHub, using clear commit messages.  

### **GitHub Commits:**  

Iâ€™ll include a **screenshot** of some of my GitHub commit edits:

### **Final Thoughts**  

This reflection is structured to feel **natural and personal**, while still being professional and Markdown-friendly. If you want me to tweak anything furtherâ€”like adding **more links, visuals, or specific examples from your projects**â€”let me know! ðŸš€
