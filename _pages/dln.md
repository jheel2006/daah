# **Reflections on Digital Literacy: A CS + IM Studentâ€™s Perspective**  

As a **Computer Science and Interactive Media** major, my experience with digital literacy extends beyond basic content creation and research. I interact with digital tools dailyâ€”not just as a user but as a designer, developer, and problem solver. Digital literacy, for me, is about understanding **how digital systems function**, critically evaluating their impact, and creatively using them to build interactive experiences. This semester, I want to refine my ability to **analyze, manipulate, and create digital content** while deepening my understanding of **AI, data visualization, and computational media**.  

## **Digital Literacy in Content Creation and Social Interaction**  

My approach to content creation often involves **programming, digital design, and interactive storytelling**. Instead of blogging platforms like Medium, I use:  

- **GitHub Pages** â€“ for hosting interactive media projects and documentation.  
- **p5.js and Three.js** â€“ for creative coding and generative visuals.  
- **Unity and Unreal Engine** â€“ for immersive experiences and game development.  
- **Figma and Adobe XD** â€“ for UI/UX prototyping and interactive web design.  

Collaboration is equally important. While tools like **Slack and Trello** are popular for teamwork, I prefer:  

- **GitHub Projects** â€“ for version control, project tracking, and team contributions.  
- **Discord** â€“ for discussions in interactive media and game dev communities.  
- **Notion** â€“ for organizing documentation and brainstorming design workflows.  

A crucial part of my digital literacy is understanding how platforms shape **interaction and engagement**. From designing user-friendly interfaces to **considering accessibility** in interactive systems, I aim to refine my skills in **creating more inclusive and intuitive digital experiences**.  

## **Digital Research and Data Management**  

As a CS student, data management goes beyond simple citation tracking. Instead of **Zotero**, I use:  

- **Jupyter Notebooks & Colab** â€“ for experimenting with data analysis and machine learning.  
- **SQL & Firebase** â€“ for handling structured and real-time data.  
- **APIs & Web Scraping** â€“ for retrieving data from external sources.  

For **data visualization and analysis**, I work with:  

- **Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)** â€“ for generating insights from datasets.  
- **TensorFlow & OpenCV** â€“ for AI-driven image and pattern recognition.  
- **D3.js** â€“ for dynamic, web-based visualizations.  

These tools allow me to explore the **intersection of code, creativity, and computation**â€”helping me understand **how digital systems process and present information**.  

## **Digital Humanities & Computational Thinking**  

What excites me most about digital literacy is how it connects **technology with the arts and humanities**. The **digital humanities** field offers a unique perspectiveâ€”bridging technical and creative disciplines through **AI-generated art, interactive storytelling, and media analysis**.  

For example:  
- AI tools like **Runway ML and Stable Diffusion** are transforming creative work by generating art based on textual input.  
- **Generative design** in p5.js and Processing enables dynamic, algorithm-driven visual compositions.  
- **Narrative AI systems** can generate dialogue for interactive experiences, impacting storytelling and game design.  

This semester, I want to explore how **computational thinking**, as described by Berry and Fagerjord, can enhance problem-solving in interactive media. This involves:  
- Understanding how **machine learning models** can inform creative processes.  
- Applying **algorithmic approaches** to generative storytelling and AI-driven experiences.  
- Critically reflecting on how **data and AI shape digital culture** ([AI in Museums](https://www.transcript-publishing.com/978-3-8376-6710-3/ai-in-museums/?number=978-3-8394-6710-7)).  

## **Critical Reflections and Future Growth**  

While I have a strong foundation in **coding, design, and digital media**, there are areas I want to improve:  

- **Ethical AI & Bias** â€“ How can we create AI systems that are **more ethical, unbiased, and transparent**?  
- **Real-time Graphics & XR** â€“ How can I push the boundaries of **interactive media through AR/VR and real-time rendering**?  
- **Generative AI in Creativity** â€“ How can AI be used **responsibly and creatively** in art, design, and storytelling?  

## **Conclusion**  

Digital literacy is an evolving practiceâ€”one that requires constant **learning, experimentation, and reflection**. As I navigate this semester, I hope to expand my understanding of **AI, computational media, and data visualization**, while refining my ability to **think critically about digital systems**. The liberal arts and interdisciplinary collaboration provide the perfect space to **merge technology, creativity, and ethics**â€”an approach that will continue to shape my academic and professional journey.
